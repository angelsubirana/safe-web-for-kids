## Do you know what they browse with your iOS device?

### Look at the stats!

- 12% of Internet sites are of adult content.
- 25% of all search engines requests are adult content oriented.

- The average age at which your children first see adult content online is 11 and going down... 
  
Safe Web is a web browser for iPhone and iPad devices. Don't worry about what your children browse as they will only see what you let them see. Safe Web is a whitelist based Internet browser that only allows navigation to your predefined websites or domains. It creates a sandbox environment where the user can't leave the bookmarked websites. For example: you can have google.com unlocked but they cannot browse to any search result that is not in the whitelist. 

They exist other filtering solutions but they are based on just filtering already known dangerous websites. Don't trust in this kind of browsers! Hundreds of harmful sites are appearing everyday and that kind of browsers will not filter them until several weeks or months, meanwhile... your children are exposed to them.

### With Safe Web it won't happen again!
